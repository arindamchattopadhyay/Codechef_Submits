Chef and Maximum Star Value

You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN. For each valid i, the star value of the element Ai is the number of valid indices j<i such that Aj is divisible by Ai.

Chef is a curious person, so he wants to know the maximum star value in the given sequence. Help him find it.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N .
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum star value.

Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤105
1≤Ai≤106 for each valid i
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 100,000.
Subtasks
Subtask #1 (20 points): sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5,000
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

Example Input
1
7
8 1 28 4 2 6 7
Example Output
3
Explanation
A5=2 divides 4, 28 and 8, so its star value is 3. There is no element with a higher star value.
