TRAPEZIUM LOOP Problem Code: TRAPLOOPSolvedSubmit (Practice)

 
All submissions for this problem are available.Sumit is fond of various shapes but particularly he likes trapezium. He came across a 
special trapezium in which non - parallel sides are equal in length and named it as isosceles trapezium. He decided to tell about this 
fact to his friend Dhananjay.

Dhananjay thought of making a circular closed loop by joining the edges of this isosceles trapezium. So he asked Sumit to calculate the 
total number of isosceles trapezuims they will require to form a closed loop. As Sumit is busy in preparation of New Year, he asks 
for your help!

You are given a base angle x of the isosceles trapezuim click here. Your task is to calculate the total number of isosceles trapeziums 
required to form a closed loop.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer x.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line the total number of isosceles trapezuims required to form a closed circular loop. It is
guaranteed that the answer will be always a natural number.

1≤T≤100
1≤x≤89
Sample Input:
